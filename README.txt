Hello!

This .zip file contains 8 files: 

1. README.txt,  this text file you are reading right now
2. sds235-hw1.Rproj, the R Project
3. Final_Report.qmd, the quarto file which generates the visualizations and report 
4. Voter Registry.xls, the raw voter registry data used in our report
5. SDS235_Sketches.pdf, a pdf file of our sketches for the visualization
6. network_diagram.png, a network visualization created for our report
7. timeline.png, a table we created outlining key events
8. reflection.pdf, a pdf file with our reflection on the assignment

To run our code, first open the sds235-hw1.Rproj file. From there, navigate to the Final_Report.qmd and render the document. This will produce a self contained HTML file containing our visualizations and reccomendations to our "supervisor". From there, you can read the file as one would normally.
