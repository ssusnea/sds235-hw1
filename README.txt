Hello!

This .zip file contains 5 files: 

1. README.txt,  this text file you are reading right now
2. Visualizations.qmd, the quarto file which generates the visualizations and cleans the data
3. HW1 Final Report.pdf, a pdf file of our final report and visualizations
4. SDS235_Sketches.pdf, a pdf file of our sketches for the visualization
5. reflection.pdf, a pdf file with our reflection on the assignment

Note: to recreate our visualizations, you need to manually modify some of the data in the "Voter Registry.xls" file. As such, under the "DOB" column, you must modify any birthdays that do not use the correct numerical formatting (for example, manually changing "8-Apr-34" to "4/8/1934").
